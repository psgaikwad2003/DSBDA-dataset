Kalboard 360 is a multi-agent LMS, which has been designed to facilitate learning through the use of leading-edge technology. Such system provides users with a synchronous access to educational resources from any device with Internet connection. \n\nThe data is collected using a learner activity tracker tool, which called experience API (xAPI). The xAPI is a component of the training and learning architecture (TLA) that enables to monitor learning progress and learner\u2019s actions like reading an article or watching a training video. The experience API helps the learning activity providers to determine the learner, activity and objects that describe a learning experience.\nThe dataset consists of 480 student records and 16 features. The features are classified into three major categories: (1) Demographic features such as gender and nationality. (2) Academic background features such as educational stage, grade Level and section. (3) Behavioral features such as raised hand on class, opening resources, answering survey by parents, and school satisfaction.\n\nThe dataset consists of 305 males and 175 females. The students come from different origins such as 179 students are from Kuwait, 172 students are from Jordan, 28 students from Palestine, 22 students are from Iraq, 17 students from Lebanon, 12 students from Tunis, 11 students from Saudi Arabia, 9 students from Egypt, 7 students from Syria, 6 students from USA, Iran and Libya, 4 students from Morocco and one student from Venezuela.\n\nThe dataset is collected through two educational semesters: 245 student records are collected during the first semester and 235 student records are collected during the second semester. \n\nThe data set includes also the school attendance feature such as the students are classified into two categories based on their absence days: 191 students exceed 7 absence days and 289 students their absence days under 7.\n\nThis dataset includes also a new category of features; this feature is parent parturition in the educational process. Parent participation feature have two sub features: Parent Answering Survey and Parent School Satisfaction. There are 270 of the parents answered survey and 210 are not, 292 of the parents are satisfied from the school and 188 are not. \n\n(See the related papers for more details).\n\nAttributes\n============\n1 Gender - student\u0027s gender (nominal: \u0027Male\u0027 or \u0027Female\u2019) \n\n2 Nationality- student\u0027s nationality (nominal:\u2019 Kuwait\u2019,\u2019 Lebanon\u2019,\u2019 Egypt\u2019,\u2019 SaudiArabia\u2019,\u2019 USA\u2019,\u2019 Jordan\u2019,\u2019 \nVenezuela\u2019,\u2019 Iran\u2019,\u2019 Tunis\u2019,\u2019 Morocco\u2019,\u2019 Syria\u2019,\u2019 Palestine\u2019,\u2019 Iraq\u2019,\u2019 Lybia\u2019)\n\n3 Place of birth- student\u0027s Place of birth (nominal:\u2019 Kuwait\u2019,\u2019 Lebanon\u2019,\u2019 Egypt\u2019,\u2019 SaudiArabia\u2019,\u2019 USA\u2019,\u2019 Jordan\u2019,\u2019 \nVenezuela\u2019,\u2019 Iran\u2019,\u2019 Tunis\u2019,\u2019 Morocco\u2019,\u2019 Syria\u2019,\u2019 Palestine\u2019,\u2019 Iraq\u2019,\u2019 Lybia\u2019)\n\n4 Educational Stages- educational level student belongs (nominal: \u2018lowerlevel\u2019,\u2019MiddleSchool\u2019,\u2019HighSchool\u2019) \n\n5 Grade Levels- grade student belongs (nominal: \u2018G-01\u2019, \u2018G-02\u2019, \u2018G-03\u2019, \u2018G-04\u2019, \u2018G-05\u2019, \u2018G-06\u2019, \u2018G-07\u2019, \u2018G-08\u2019, \u2018G-09\u2019, \u2018G-10\u2019, \u2018G-11\u2019, \u2018G-12 \u2018) \n\n6 Section ID- classroom student belongs (nominal:\u2019A\u2019,\u2019B\u2019,\u2019C\u2019)\n\n7 Topic- course topic (nominal:\u2019 English\u2019,\u2019 Spanish\u2019, \u2018French\u2019,\u2019 Arabic\u2019,\u2019 IT\u2019,\u2019 Math\u2019,\u2019 Chemistry\u2019, \u2018Biology\u2019, \u2018Science\u2019,\u2019 History\u2019,\u2019 Quran\u2019,\u2019 Geology\u2019)\n\n8 Semester- school year semester (nominal:\u2019 First\u2019,\u2019 Second\u2019)\n\n9 Parent responsible for student (nominal:\u2019mom\u2019,\u2019father\u2019)\n\n10 Raised hand- how many times the student raises his/her hand on classroom (numeric:0-100)\n\n11- Visited resources- how many times the student visits a course content(numeric:0-100)\n\n12 Viewing announcements-how many times the student checks the new announcements(numeric:0-100)\n\n13 Discussion groups- how many times the student participate on discussion groups (numeric:0-100)\n\n14 Parent Answering Survey- parent answered the surveys which are provided from school or not \n(nominal:\u2019Yes\u2019,\u2019No\u2019)\n\n15 Parent School Satisfaction- the Degree of parent satisfaction from school(nominal:\u2019Yes\u2019,\u2019No\u2019)\n\n16 Student Absence Days-the number of absence days for each student (nominal: above-7, under-7)\n\n# The students are classified into three numerical intervals based on their total grade/mark:\n\nLow-Level: interval includes values from 0 to 69, \n\nMiddle-Level: interval includes values from 70 to 89, \n\nHigh-Level: interval includes values from 90-100.\n\nRelevant Papers:\n================\n- Amrieh, E.
